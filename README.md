# Snippet - Code Snippet App w/ Next.js, Prisma and PostgreSQL

![Snippet Manager preview image](./public/preview.gif)

## The Challenge ‚ö°Ô∏è

I wanted to finally build an app with Next.js 14, to see if it deserves all the hype.

This is a very small project as of now, and any contributions will be highly appreciated.

Some of the core features and challenges include:

- Integrating Prisma with PostgreSQL for both development and production environments.
- Developing functionality to create, list, delete, and edit code snippets.
- Combining Shadcn/ui, Prisma, and TailwindCSS with Next.js 14.
- Implementing React Hot Toast with server components.
